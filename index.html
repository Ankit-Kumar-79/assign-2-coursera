          Bhagat Singh was considered to be one of the most famous
          revolutionaries of the Bharatiya Independence movement. For this
          reason, he is often referred to as 'Shaheed' (martyr) Bhagat Singh. At
          such a young age,
          <strong>
            if anyone was smiling just before being hanged to death, it was
            Martyr Bhagat Singh.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          His uncle, Sardar Ajit Singh, as well as his father, were great
          freedom fighters, so he grew up in a patriotic atmosphere. At an early
          age, he started dreaming of uprooting the British empire. Never afraid
          of fighting during his childhood, he thought of 'growing guns in the
          fields', so that he could fight the British.

          The Ghadar Movement left a deep imprint on his mind. Kartar Singh
          Sarabha, hanged at the age of 19, became his hero. The massacre at
          Jallianwala Bagh on 13th April, 1919 drove him to Amritsar, where he
          kissed the earth sanctified by the martyrsâ€™ blood and brought back
          home a little of the soaked soil. At the age of 16, he used to wonder
          why so many Bharatiyas could not drive away a fistful of invaders.

        <h3>Revolutionary Legacy of Bhagat Singh</h3>
        <p>
          Bhagat Singh's life (September 28, 1907-March 23, 1931), work and
          thought were marked by an uncompromising struggle against colonialism
          and imperialism, together with radical opposition to capitalism,
          communalism and the caste system. This article is a spirited account
          of his life, his revolutionary activity, his ideals, his opinions and
          his legacy. It was on April 8, 1929 that Bhagat Singh and B K Dutt
          threw non-lethal bombs in the Central Assembly with a view "to make
          the deaf hear", and raised the slogans <b>"Inquilab Zindabad"</b> and
          <b>"Down with Imperialism"</b>, which caught the imagination of the
          Indian people. Perhaps at no other point in the life of India since
          1947 has the reference to these two slogans become more important than
          today, as the country marks the hundredth birth anniversary of Bhagat
          Singh.
